# cybersecurity_IBL

Welcome!  This is my backup page for my local save of the pyACTUp cybersecurity project.

In order to set up the model, adjust the parameters in `model.py` to your liking.  The ULRs should link to CSV files in the NSL_KDD dataset (https://github.com/defcom17/NSL_KDD/tree/master).

Ensure the URLs reference the raw data of the CSV files and not github's rendering of the CSV file; otherwise the code will not be able to parse the CSV.
