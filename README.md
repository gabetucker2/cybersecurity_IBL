# cybersecurity_IBL

Welcomeâ€”this is the backup page for my pyACT-UP (ACT-R) cybersecurity project.

Completed:
* Get pyactup working, replicating Dr. Lebiere's LISP results, with modular structure (100% done, has all options needed)
* Get feature importance analysis working, with modular structure (70% done, need to add alternatives to original and add modularity)

TODO:
PART 1:
* BY WEDNESDAY: Get random forest algorithm working in pureFeatureImportance project with modular structure as alternative
* Implement class-based feature importance analysis code and distinguish it from model-based feature importance analysis code

PART 2:
* Make pyactup code clearer (e.g., no need for "train_dict", use the pandas procedural datasets from the preprocessing script instead, have uniform preprocessed datasets, potentially have an original preprocessed and an epoch-wise preprocessed dataset that draws from the original?)
* Combine pureFeatureImportance project and pyactup project to run on the same model.py script

PART 3:
* Get NN to run locally using the new file that Rob sent me
* Get NN to run with the same datasets/parameters structure I used for actup and feature importance

PART 4:
* Integrate NN into pyactup
* Integrate NN/pyactup/feature importance all in one folder with one parameters and one datasets file as final product
