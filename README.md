# cybersecurity_IBL

Welcomeâ€”this is the backup page for my pyACT-UP (ACT-R) cybersecurity project.

In order to set up the model, adjust the parameters in `parameters.py` and the arguments in `model.py`'s function calls to your liking and run it using `py model.py`.  The ULRs should link to CSV files in the NSL_KDD dataset (https://github.com/defcom17/NSL_KDD/tree/master), which are used for training and testing.

The model is currently running with ~70% accuracy with partial retrieval and partial blending.
