partial matchung

mismatch penalty

the similarity penalty itself

look into retrieval threshold

3 cases
numeric output - you don't want this version
output is a chunk
chunks with similarities between them, combination

Send Don an email, CC Lebiere

use similarity function, numer-similarities

temp parameter is 1.0 for blending

he thinks blend is numerical, best-blend is symbolic

order of magnitude categorical frequency diff

Ensure 10 instances of each of 9 intrusion, 90 for normal, pre-store different instances

even with 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 9 works with some accuracy

There's also code he wrote that only adds instances  that it CANNOT predict accurately already

Rob did multidimensionality visualization to show some categories are not separable

DL model can get fine-tuned details between the ones that are close

He has correlation matrix

Talk with Rob about connecting direcftly to DL model

Reason for blending is we don't depend on the closest match being the right match

Only correct for explicitly trained instances
